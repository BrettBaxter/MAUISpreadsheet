# Project Name:

    Formula

# Time Expenditures:

    1. Predicted Hours:          8        Actual Hours:   9
        a. Time to write: 4 hours
        b. Time to debug: 4 hours
        c. Time to research: 1 hour

# Comments to Evaluators:

    Seemed fairly straight-forward. I liked completely checking whether a function was valid before doing any evaluation on it, it felt way more clean. Now I
    can remove most error checking inside the evaluate function! Also cleaned out a bunch of useless code thanks to the code coverage visualization from my old evaluator
    function.
