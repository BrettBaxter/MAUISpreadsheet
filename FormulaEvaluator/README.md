# Comments to Evaluators:

    This assignment was fairly straight forward for me. It took a little while to understand why the provided algorithm was the way it was,
    but after doing some work on paper and drawing it out it made sense. The console application was useful in quick testing, but I look forward to using
    actual C# unit tests.
