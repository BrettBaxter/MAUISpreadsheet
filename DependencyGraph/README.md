# Comments to Evaluators:

    Was very confused about this assignment until the lecture on Tuesday the 24th, the comments about using mirrored dictionary really helped steer me in the right direction.
    Spent a good hour fixing a git problem, fatal git error visual studio couldn't access my repo, had to edit windows credential manager because I have another personal github account.
    I don't know why it happened, everything was fine before this. Also wasted a lot of time on the replace functions, forgot I just wrote the add and remove methods that make
    these functions really easy.
