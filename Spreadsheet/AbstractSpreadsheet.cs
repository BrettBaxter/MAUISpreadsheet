// Assignment 5
// Written by Joe Zachary for CS 3500, September 2013
// Version 1.8
// Revision history:  
//   Version 1.1 9/20/12 12:59 p.m.  Fixed comment that describes circular dependencies
//   Version 1.2 9/20/12 1:38 p.m.   Changed return type of GetCellContents to object
//   Version 1.3 9/24/12 8:41 a.m.   Modified the specification of GetCellsToRecalculate by 
//                                   adding a requirement for the names parameter
// Branched from PS4Skeleton
//   Version 1.4                     Branched from PS4Skeleton
//           Edited class comment for AbstractSpreadsheet
//           Made the three SetCellContents methods protected
//           Added a new method SetContentsOfCell.  This method abstract.
//           Added a new method GetCellValue.  This method is abstract.
//           Added a new property Changed.  This property is abstract.
//           Added a new method Save.  This method is abstract.
//           Added a new method GetSavedVersion.  This method is abstract.
//           Added a new class SpreadsheetReadWriteException.
//           Added IsValid, Normalize, and Version properties
//           Added a constructor for AbstractSpreadsheet

// Revision history:
//    Version 1.5 9/28/12 2:22 p.m.   Fixed example in comment for Save
//    Version 1.6 9/29/12 11:07 a.m.  Put a constructor into SpreadsheetReadWriteException
//    Version 1.7 9/29/12 11:14 a.m.  Added missing </summary> tag to comment
//    
//    Version 1.8 (Daniel Kopta)      Unified error checking for setting cell contents
//                (Fall 2019)         SetCellContents signatures changed to return IList
//    Version 1.9 (Jim de St. Germain) Updated documentation
//    Version 1.91 (Jim de St. Germain) Removed Null requirement checking (C# supports non-nullables!)
//
