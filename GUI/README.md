# Project Name:

    GUI

# Time Expenditures:

    Predicted Hours:          10        Actual Hours:   11


# Comments to Evaluators:

    MAUI was very daunting, I wasn't sure how a project should be structured. It took some time going through lecture recording and lab to see how I should plug
    everything together.

# Assignment Writeups:

    Design Decisions:
        1. Added a dedicated exit button, it interacts with the unsaved changes pop-up to warn the user about closing the program before saving.
        2. Added some indicators to let the user know that they have not saved, up by the cell content entry widget at the top you can see the name of the
           file being currently used.
        3. If there are any unsaved changes in the spreadsheet there will be an indicator next to the file name indicator, this will go away after saving.

    Punt:
        1. Horizontal scroll view does not interact with the horizontal top bar.
        2. Variable recognition, could not figure out how to make the spreadsheet recognize A6 = a6.

    Time Tracking:
        My time estimates appear to be about correct, sometimes I underestimate, other times I overestimate. I definitely started this assignment too late, I did not have much
        knowledge on .net MAUI before this assignment so there was much more time spent researching than usual.
        I am fairly confident in my abilities, I'm not amazing at figuring out the best approach to the assignment but I am confident I can get them done and submitted on time.
